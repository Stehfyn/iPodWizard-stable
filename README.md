# iPodWizard-stable

## Notice
I have suspended development on this thing until I graduate in the fall of '23 with my bachelors in cse.
## How To Use
  
## About
  There are stable binaries to ipw 1.3, but its source code is incomplete and missing a custom zlib from the early 00's. This project originally was aimed to bring feature parity in its source to the circulating binary, however its MFC madness greatly hinders code clarity. Once I have the time a full rewrite in modern C++ with an immediate mode gui, feature parity, and more.
## Build Dependencies
  * - Visual Studio Pro 2005 (VC++ 8.0/MFC 7.0.0 thru 8.0.X)
  * - iTunes 7.0.2.16
